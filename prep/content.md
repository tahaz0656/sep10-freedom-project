Topic: **Electrical Engineering**
## Intro/Context/Overview:
Electrical Engineering is the study and use of electricity, electronics, systems, and components. Electrical Engineers apply principles of mathematics and physics to create new technologies that impact a number of industries and it is used also used to solve problems.
Some key aspects of electrical engineering is:
  * Problem-solving
  * Testing and analysis
  * Project management
  * Design and Development
## Part A: existing technology
# Software
* 1st Google search: "Electrical Engineering technology apps"
* 1st website looked into: "https://interestingengineering.com/lists/13-engineering-apps-that-are-a-must-for-all-engineers"
  * After reading and observing this website, I had seen it had ranked the 13th best engineering apps and also what these apps are used for.
  * I made a conclusion that a good app that I can research on would be "Droid Tesla"
  * First app review I looked at was "Droid Tesla"
    * "https://www.solopointsolutions.com/2017/11/14/must-have-apps-for-electrical-engineers/"
    * This app is the only electronic circuit simulator for android.
    * This app solves basic circuits using Kirchoff's Current law (KCL)
    * This simulator forms a matrix according to KCL
    * Then starts to solve for the unknown quantities using algebraic technologies.
    * This app is also free
    * This app is also suitable for all types of being like students, hobbyists, and professionals.
  * Second app review I looked at was "Engineering Unit Convertor & Calculator"
    * "https://www.solopointsolutions.com/2017/11/14/must-have-apps-for-electrical-engineers/"
    * This app is a tool that converts measurments between different units.
    * Such as meters to miles and Pascals to Psi
    * Easy to read text with an intelligent, customizable display system.
    * This tool is essential for hanndling complex calculations and avoiding mistakes
  # Hardware/Devices
  * Google search: "CyberKnife"
  * The website I looked into was: "https://cyberknife.com/cyberknife-how-it-works/"
     * This device/system is a non-invasive treatment for cancerous and non-cancerous tumors and other conditions where radiation therapy is indicated.
     * This device/system is used for treating conditions throughout the body, including the prostate, lung, brain, spine, head and neck, liver, pancreas and kidney.
     * This can also be used as an alternative to surgery or for patients who have inoperable or surgically complex tumors.
     * This CyberKnife treatment is typically performed in 1-5 sessions.
     * The CyberKnife System is the only radiation delivery system that features a linear accelerator (linac).
     * This is directly set on a robot to deliver the high-energy x-rays or photons used in radiation therapy.
     * The robot moves and bends around the patient, to deliver radiation doses from potentially thousands of unique beam angles.
     * This significantly expands the possible positions to concentrate radiations to the tumor.
     * It also does so while minimizing dose to surrounding healthy tissue.
     * This robotic delivery and real-time image guidance have set the standard for delivery precision.
     * It has also enabled stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments for the full range of tumor types.
     * The advanced motion synchronization technology eliminates the need to use uncomfortable patient restraints, or ask patients to hold their breath for example.
     * The CyberKnife System has more than two decades of clinical proof and has helped thousands of cancer patients.
## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
 I am currently on the researching the problem (step 2) and finding possible solutions (step 3) steps for my EDP (Engineering Design Process). My main goal right now is too find ways that electrical engineering can furthermore help solve problems in society. Problems like littering, starvation, renewable energy, and lack of biomedical systems. My next stage is too find possible solutions on how electrical engineering can solve a lot of these problems.
## Skills
Some skills that I've learned from working on this blog would **communication** and **time management**
#### Communication
During the time Mr. Mueller gave us during his class to work on this blog, I had talked to Ethan Li on how we were going to work together since he is doing "mechanical engineering" and I'm doing "electrical engineering". We talked to Mr. Mueller about and he made us research what kind of technology includes both mechanical and electrical enngineering, we found a system called the "Cyberknife" that both electrical and mechanical engineers work on and had used that system to base our research of. This type of commincation had helped me a lot on my blog because it gave me like an idea of what I was going to research and write about.
#### Time management
After the school day I go to manage for the girls volleyball team or I am in practice for the boys volleyball team and I usually get home very late and on the weekends I do boxing which takes up a lot of my weekend. This had created a problem because the schoolwork and homeworks are increasing by the day and it is very hard to manage so much homeworks while I get home very late. So, I've learned to manage my time better by doing some of my homework in lunch and not spending so much time playing games when I get home and instead take a mini break and start focusing on completing all of my homework.
