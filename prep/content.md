## Part A: existing technology
* 1st Google search: "Electrical Engineering technology apps"
* 1st website looked into: "https://interestingengineering.com/lists/13-engineering-apps-that-are-a-must-for-all-engineers"
  * After reading and observing this website, I had seen it had ranked the 13th best engineering apps and also what these apps are used for.
  * I made a conclusion that a good app that I can research on would be "Droid Tesla"
  * First app review I looked at was "Droid Tesla"
    * "https://www.solopointsolutions.com/2017/11/14/must-have-apps-for-electrical-engineers/"
    * This app is the only electronic circuit simulator for android.
    * This app solves basic circuits using Kirchoff's Current law (KCL)
    * This simulator forms a matrix according to KCL
    * Then starts to solve for the unknown quantities using algebraic technologies.
    * This app is also free
    * This app is also suitable for all types of being like students, hobbyists, and professionals.
  * Second app review I looked at was "Engineering Unit Convertor & Calculator"
    * "https://www.solopointsolutions.com/2017/11/14/must-have-apps-for-electrical-engineers/"
    * This app is a tool that converts measurments between different units.
    * Such as meters to miles and Pascals to Psi
    * Easy to read text with an intelligent, customizable display system.
    * This tool is essential for hanndling complex calculations and avoiding mistakes
