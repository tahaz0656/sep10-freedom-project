## Part A: existing technology
# Software
* 1st Google search: "Electrical Engineering technology apps"
* 1st website looked into: "https://interestingengineering.com/lists/13-engineering-apps-that-are-a-must-for-all-engineers"
  * After reading and observing this website, I had seen it had ranked the 13th best engineering apps and also what these apps are used for.
  * I made a conclusion that a good app that I can research on would be "Droid Tesla"
  * First app review I looked at was "Droid Tesla"
    * "https://www.solopointsolutions.com/2017/11/14/must-have-apps-for-electrical-engineers/"
    * This app is the only electronic circuit simulator for android.
    * This app solves basic circuits using Kirchoff's Current law (KCL)
    * This simulator forms a matrix according to KCL
    * Then starts to solve for the unknown quantities using algebraic technologies.
    * This app is also free
    * This app is also suitable for all types of being like students, hobbyists, and professionals.
  * Second app review I looked at was "Engineering Unit Convertor & Calculator"
    * "https://www.solopointsolutions.com/2017/11/14/must-have-apps-for-electrical-engineers/"
    * This app is a tool that converts measurments between different units.
    * Such as meters to miles and Pascals to Psi
    * Easy to read text with an intelligent, customizable display system.
    * This tool is essential for hanndling complex calculations and avoiding mistakes
  # Hardware/Devices
  * Google search: "CyberKnife"
  * The website I looked into was: "https://cyberknife.com/cyberknife-how-it-works/"
     * This device/system is a non-invasive treatment for cancerous and non-cancerous tumors and other conditions where radiation therapy is indicated.
     * This device/system is used for treating conditions throughout the body, including the prostate, lung, brain, spine, head and neck, liver, pancreas and kidney.
     * This can also be used as an alternative to surgery or for patients who have inoperable or surgically complex tumors.
     * This CyberKnife treatment is typically performed in 1-5 sessions.
     * The CyberKnife System is the only radiation delivery system that features a linear accelerator (linac).
     * This is directly set on a robot to deliver the high-energy x-rays or photons used in radiation therapy.
     * The robot moves and bends around the patient, to deliver radiation doses from potentially thousands of unique beam angles.
     * This significantly expands the possible positions to concentrate radiations to the tumor.
     * It also does so while minimizing dose to surrounding healthy tissue.
     * This robotic delivery and real-time image guidance have set the standard for delivery precision.
     * It has also enabled stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) treatments for the full range of tumor types.
     * The advanced motion synchronization technology eliminates the need to use uncomfortable patient restraints, or ask patients to hold their breath for example.
     * The CyberKnife System has more than two decades of clinical proof and has helped thousands of cancer patients.
## EDP (Engineering Design Process)
 I am currently on the researching the problem (step 2) and finding possible solutions (step 3) steps for my EDP (Engineering Design Process). My main goal right now is too find ways that electrical engineering can furthermore help solve problems in society. Problems like littering, starvation, renewable energy, and lack of biomedical systems. My next stage is too find possible solutions on how electrical engineering can solve a lot of these problems.
