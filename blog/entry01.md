## Why Electrical Enginnering?
The topic I have choosen for this project is Electrial Enginneering this was due to the fact that I would like to become a electrical enginneer when I grow up. I also chose this topic because I knew that technology was massively involved in electrical engineering due that fact that they design, develop, and test electrial systems. I had also considered doing environmental science or chemistry but I soon decided that Electrical Enginneering would the best topic for me. The article that was most intresting had persauded me to choose Electircal Enginneeing as my topic would be [Technology Trends in Electrical Engineering](https://www.excelsior.edu/article/innovations-in-electricalengineering/#:~:text=Artificial%20intelligence%20(AI)%20enhances%20efficiency,minimizing%20downtime%20for%20many%20businesses.) by Jenna Kirwin. Seeing all the different ways artifical intelligence can improve Electrical Enginneeing has inspired to also come up with new ways that technology can help advance Electrical Engineering.
## Engineering Design Process
I am currently still on the (step 1) defining and (step 2) resaerching steps of the EDP(engineering design process). My main goal right now is to still find a problem. The problem that O hope to solve with my project is a stop/decrease in electrical surges. My next stage is to research the problem and I plan to create a way that technology can help stop electricl surges with researching study's and projects that are already trying to solve this issue.
## Skills
Some skills that I have learned from this blog are time management and how to google.
#### Time management
After the school day I go to manage for the girls volleyball team or I am in practice for the boys volleyball team and I usually get home very late and on the weekends I do boxing which takes up a lot of my weekend. This had created a problem because the schoolwork and homeworks are increasing by the day and it is very hard to manage so much homeworks while I get home very late. So, I've learned to manage my time better by doing some of my homework in lunch and not spending so much time playing games when I get home and instead take a mini break and start focusing on completing all of my work.
#### How to Google
When I had googled all the topics I was intrested in to find the perfect topic for me, I had gotten a lot of useless information and bad sites that had fake information. So from this I had learned to skim through stuff better and find good reliable sources that provided me the important information that I had needed.
## Next steps
I am excited to start researching for possible solutions on how technology can help produce something that will stop electrical surges from happening.
